# Open Open API Definitions

We create value through collaboration and integration, allowing our businesses to do what we do best, and rely on others to do the rest. However, there are currently friction points between services in the way of differing API specifications. The [Open API Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/) is focused on creating, evolving, and promoting a vendor neutral API Description Format.

> The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the guesswork in calling the service.

This repository is meant to be a list of Open API definitions for companies who have already adopted the specification; as well as collaboration on Open API definitions for common APIs which have not yet created their own. This is by no means definitive. Contributions are welcome if you find things that would be generally useful.

Let's spend less time re-defining the pre-defined and move on with our collective futures and what we came here to do -- make a difference in the world!
